            <p>Terry is three years old. He spends his days sitting in the sun and eating. 
                Among his favorite foods are dark, leafy greens, strawberries, and watermelon.
                He also appreciates extra calcium sprinkled on his meals to make his shell big and strong. 
                He spends hours a day eating as his mouth is quite small but wonâ€™t eat food after its been 
                dried out by the sun for a while. </p>
            <p>Terry is a tortoise of few words. He is generally pretty quiet although he has a hidden 
                sassy side to his personality especially when it comes to his food. Terry is a smart 
                tortoise who can do a few tricks such as hiding in his shell or going for a swim in 
                shallow water. </p>
