            <h2>Terry</h2>
            <img src="images/terry.jpg" alt="Russian Turtle walking in grass" width="400" height="">
            <p>Terry is three years old. He spends his days sitting in the sun and eating. 
                Among his favorite foods are dark, leafy greens, strawberries, and watermelon.
                He also appreciates extra calcium sprinkled on his meals to make his shell big and strong. 
                He spends hours a day eating as his mouth is quite small but wonâ€™t eat food after its been 
                dried out by the sun for a while. </p>
            <p>Terry is a tortoise of few words. He is generally pretty quiet although he has a hidden 
                sassy side to his personality especially when it comes to his food. Terry is a smart 
                tortoise who can do a few tricks such as hiding in his shell or going for a swim in 
                shallow water. </p>

            <h2>Rocky</h2>
            <img src="images/rocky.jpg" alt="Black and grey cat laying on couch in sunlight" width="400" height="">
            <p>Rocky is a young kitten that stays inside and cuddles with his owner all day. His favorite place is hang 
                out is on the left side of the couch with his red blanket. When he's not laying down and sleeping, he's eating 
                favorite snacks such as catnip and dirt. He also appreciates bellyrubs and head scratches, especially on Saturdays
                and Sundays.</p>
            <p>Because Rocky enjoys resting and fueling up so much, he was a lot of energy in his freetime to for lots of zoomies and 
                distracting his owners from doing their homework. He loves knocking things off of high surfaces and can't stand when 
                things are where they're supposed to be. His owners thinks he's too cute to be yelled at so they usually let him get away
                with these things which is probably why he keeps doing it. </p>

            <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>
